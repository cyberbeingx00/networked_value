The Age of Networked Value

The new economy is the network economy. The structure that pervades throughout the network economy, of course, is the value network. A value network can take an infinite number of forms, however, they all have these common characteristics: nodes and connections between nodes that generate value for different users of the value network. Nodes could be anything: people, cars, devices, records in a database etc. Connections between nodes can also take an infinite number of forms: someone taking a ride in a taxicab, someone calling someone on a phone, someone watching a movie, two devices connecting etc. Users and the entities being provided the value from the value network would ultimately be people. Even if a value network consists solely of non-human nodes and connections, it is ultimately humans that will be provided the value from that value network. For instance, a value network could consist entirely of computer devices and the connections between those devices. However, the devices themselves have no notion or experience of value since they are not conscious. It is the users of the computer devices that ultimately derive the value from the computer device based value network.
As it was mentioned previously, any aspect of an economy could be modeled as a value network. However, the recent innovations in information technology over the past ~100 years have enabled the creation of value networks in ways that are incomprehensibly more powerful than anything before ~100 years ago. The technologies that have enabled vastly more powerful value networks can be boiled down to an essential set of capabilities: creating, storing, manipulating and transmitting large quantities of information at near the speed of light via electricity. With this set of capabilities, which are essentially available to anyone who has access to a computer and the Internet, an explosion of value networks becomes a mathematical inevitability. The ability to discern value networks within the economy is also greatly enhanced by the capability to store information about nodes and connections between nodes in a computer database. Parts of the economy which are not neatly stored in a computer database can be much more difficult to discern through the lense of value networks. This lack of tangible, well-defined data in a database is often where economists step in and apply theories in order to explain phenomenon in any economy and where value is being generated. However, these theories are contested amongst even the highest caliber economists. Therefore, there are value networks that are well defined and other value networks that are not well defined. While there is no precise spectrum between these 2 different kinds of value networks, a well-defined value network is one in which one can make precise queries on a database to compute aspects of the nodes and connections between the nodes. If this capability does not exist, then we simply call the value network 'not well defined'. This writing is only concerned with well-defined value networks that can be queried in a database. Therefore, going forward, the phrase value network will mean a well-defined value network.
What do AirBnB, Facebook, Uber and Amazon all have in common? They are all successful businesses built on carefully crafted value networks. AirBnB connects people to rooms to rent. Facebook connects people to each other via Web technologies. Uber connects people to cars and drivers. Amazon connects people to a vast array of retail products. One hallmark of a value network in the digital age is reflected in the fact that resources, knowledge and localized opportunity cannot be captured entirely by a single hierarchical entity. AirBnB would just be another hotel business if it did not have people offer spare rooms via its site. AirBnB can offer a far greater amount of variety to its customers than a hotel chain can because the hosts that post to AirBnB can offer rooms of all sorts since they are individually owned/operated. A hotel chain must cut costs by standardizing rooms. Facebook (the company) could not possibly generate the content the billions of users of Facebook upload to its site every day. More than 50% of Amazon's products are sold by third party sellers. Amazon could not possibly manage all of the supply chains for all of the niche retail products that are sold on its site.
